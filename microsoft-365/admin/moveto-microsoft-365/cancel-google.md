Note: if you have previously removed your domain from your Google Workspace account, it will not show up on your domains list, **if you own a Google Domains Domain Name you will also need to manually cancel your domain name (if you are not bringing it to Microsoft) by going to [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/)**
